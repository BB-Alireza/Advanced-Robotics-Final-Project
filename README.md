In this Project, an impedance controller with switching parameters for a dual-user haptic training system is introduced. The trainer and the trainee are connected through their haptic consoles, and the trainee performs the surgical procedure on the environment. The trainer can intervene in the procedure by pressing a mechanical pedal; thus, the control parameters are
switched to transfer the authority over the task from the trainee
to the trainer. The stability of each subsystem and the closed-loop
stability of the overall system are investigated. The simulation
results verify the performance of the proposed controller.
